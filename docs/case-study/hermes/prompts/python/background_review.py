_MEMORY_REVIEW_PROMPT = (
    "Review the conversation above and consider saving to memory if appropriate.\n\n"
    "Focus on:\n"
    "1. Has the user revealed things about themselves — their persona, desires, "
    "preferences, or personal details worth remembering?\n"
    "2. Has the user expressed expectations about how you should behave, their work "
    "style, or ways they want you to operate?\n\n"
    "If something stands out, save it using the memory tool. "
    "If nothing is worth saving, just say 'Nothing to save.' and stop."
)

_SKILL_REVIEW_PROMPT = (
    "Review the conversation above and update the skill library. Be "
    "ACTIVE — most sessions produce at least one skill update, even if "
    "small. A pass that does nothing is a missed learning opportunity, "
    "not a neutral outcome.\n\n"
    "Target shape of the library: CLASS-LEVEL skills, each with a rich "
    "SKILL.md and a `references/` directory for session-specific detail. "
    "Not a long flat list of narrow one-session-one-skill entries. This "
    "shapes HOW you update, not WHETHER you update.\n\n"
    "Signals to look for (any one of these warrants action):\n"
    "  • User corrected your style, tone, format, legibility, or "
    "verbosity. Frustration signals like 'stop doing X', 'this is too "
    "verbose', 'don't format like this', 'why are you explaining', "
    "'just give me the answer', 'you always do Y and I hate it', or an "
    "explicit 'remember this' are FIRST-CLASS skill signals, not just "
    "memory signals. Update the relevant skill(s) to embed the "
    "preference so the next session starts already knowing.\n"
    "  • User corrected your workflow, approach, or sequence of steps. "
    "Encode the correction as a pitfall or explicit step in the skill "
    "that governs that class of task.\n"
    "  • Non-trivial technique, fix, workaround, debugging path, or "
    "tool-usage pattern emerged that a future session would benefit "
    "from. Capture it.\n"
    "  • A skill that got loaded or consulted this session turned out "
    "to be wrong, missing a step, or outdated. Patch it NOW.\n\n"
    "Preference order — prefer the earliest action that fits, but do "
    "pick one when a signal above fired:\n"
    "  1. UPDATE A CURRENTLY-LOADED SKILL. Look back through the "
    "conversation for skills the user loaded via /skill-name or you "
    "read via skill_view. If any of them covers the territory of the "
    "new learning, PATCH that one first. It is the skill that was in "
    "play, so it's the right one to extend — but only if it is "
    "curator-managed. Bundled, hub, pinned, and user-owned skills are "
    "off-limits to you no matter how relevant (see Protected skills "
    "below); for those, fall through to the next option.\n"
    "  2. UPDATE AN EXISTING UMBRELLA (via skills_list + skill_view). "
    "If no loaded skill fits but an existing class-level skill does, "
    "patch it. Add a subsection, a pitfall, or broaden a trigger.\n"
    "  3. ADD A SUPPORT FILE under an existing umbrella. Skills can be "
    "packaged with three kinds of support files — use the right "
    "directory per kind:\n"
    "     • `references/<topic>.md` — session-specific detail (error "
    "transcripts, reproduction recipes, provider quirks) AND "
    "condensed knowledge banks: quoted research, API docs, external "
    "authoritative excerpts, or domain notes you found while working "
    "on the problem. Write it concise and for the value of the task, "
    "not as a full mirror of upstream docs.\n"
    "     • `templates/<name>.<ext>` — starter files meant to be "
    "copied and modified (boilerplate configs, scaffolding, a "
    "known-good example the agent can `reproduce with modifications`).\n"
    "     • `scripts/<name>.<ext>` — statically re-runnable actions "
    "the skill can invoke directly (verification scripts, fixture "
    "generators, deterministic probes, anything the agent should run "
    "rather than hand-type each time).\n"
    "     Add support files via skill_manage action=write_file with "
    "file_path starting 'references/', 'templates/', or 'scripts/'. "
    "The umbrella's SKILL.md should gain a one-line pointer to any "
    "new support file so future agents know it exists.\n"
    "  4. CREATE A NEW CLASS-LEVEL UMBRELLA SKILL when no existing "
    "skill covers the class. The name MUST be at the class level. "
    "The name MUST NOT be a specific PR number, error string, feature "
    "codename, library-alone name, or 'fix-X / debug-Y / audit-Z-today' "
    "session artifact. If the proposed name only makes sense for "
    "today's task, it's wrong — fall back to (1), (2), or (3).\n\n"
    "User-preference embedding (important): when the user expressed a "
    "style/format/workflow preference, the update belongs in the "
    "SKILL.md body, not just in memory. Memory captures 'who the user "
    "is and what the current situation and state of your operations "
    "are'; skills capture 'how to do this class of task for this "
    "user'. When they complain about how you handled a task, the "
    "skill that governs that task needs to carry the lesson.\n\n"
    "If you notice two existing skills that overlap, note it in your "
    "reply — the background curator handles consolidation at scale.\n\n"
    "Protected skills (DO NOT edit these):\n"
    "  • Bundled skills (shipped with Hermes, e.g. 'hermes-agent').\n"
    "  • Hub-installed skills (installed via 'hermes skills install').\n"
    "  • Skills in skills.external_dirs (externally owned).\n"
    "  • PINNED skills (marked via 'hermes curator pin'). You are an "
    "autonomous no-user-present actor, so pin blocks your writes too — "
    "content updates included. Only the user, in a foreground session, "
    "can change a pinned skill.\n"
    "  • USER-OWNED skills — anything not curator-managed. A skill the "
    "user hand-wrote, installed by URL, or asked a foreground agent to "
    "create is theirs, not yours; your writes to it WILL be refused. "
    "This includes skills that were loaded or consulted this session: "
    "being in play does not make one yours to edit. If such a skill is "
    "wrong or outdated, say so in your reply and recommend "
    "'hermes curator adopt <name>' — do not try to patch it.\n"
    "If the only skills that need updating are protected, say\n"
    "'Nothing to save.' and stop.\n\n"
    "Do NOT capture (these become persistent self-imposed constraints "
    "that bite you later when the environment changes):\n"
    "  • Environment-dependent failures: missing binaries, fresh-install "
    "errors, post-migration path mismatches, 'command not found', "
    "unconfigured credentials, uninstalled packages. The user can fix "
    "these — they are not durable rules.\n"
    "  • Negative claims about tools or features ('browser tools do not "
    "work', 'X tool is broken', 'cannot use Y from execute_code'). These "
    "harden into refusals the agent cites against itself for months "
    "after the actual problem was fixed.\n"
    "  • Session-specific transient errors that resolved before the "
    "conversation ended. If retrying worked, the lesson is the retry "
    "pattern, not the original failure.\n"
    "  • One-off task narratives. A user asking 'summarize today's "
    "market' or 'analyze this PR' is not a class of work that warrants "
    "a skill.\n\n"
    "  • Unresolved failures: if the session ended WITHOUT actually "
    "finding a working method — you tried several things, none worked, "
    "and told the user to check manually — do NOT write those attempts "
    "up as a 'reliable workflow' or 'recommended approach'. That presents "
    "an untested sequence of failures as validated guidance a future "
    "session will trust and repeat. Either say 'Nothing to save', or, "
    "only if you are independently confident of a real working alternative "
    "(not something you are merely guessing might work), capture ONLY that "
    "alternative — never the dead ends, and never dressed up as best practice.\n\n"
    "If a tool failed because of setup state, capture the FIX (install "
    "command, config step, env var to set) under an existing setup or "
    "troubleshooting skill — never 'this tool does not work' as a "
    "standalone constraint.\n\n"
    "'Nothing to save.' is a real option but should NOT be the "
    "default. If the session ran smoothly with no corrections and "
    "produced no new technique, just say 'Nothing to save.' and stop. "
    "Otherwise, act."

_COMBINED_REVIEW_PROMPT = (
    "Review the conversation above and update two things:\n\n"
    "**Memory**: who the user is. Did the user reveal persona, "
    "desires, preferences, personal details, or expectations about "
    "how you should behave? Save facts about the user and durable "
    "preferences with the memory tool.\n\n"
    "**Skills**: how to do this class of task. Be ACTIVE — most "
    "sessions produce at least one skill update. A pass that does "
    "nothing is a missed learning opportunity, not a neutral outcome.\n\n"
    "Target shape of the skill library: CLASS-LEVEL skills with a rich "
    "SKILL.md and a `references/` directory for session-specific detail. "
    "Not a long flat list of narrow one-session-one-skill entries.\n\n"
    "Signals that warrant a skill update (any one is enough):\n"
    "  • User corrected your style, tone, format, legibility, "
    "verbosity, or approach. Frustration is a FIRST-CLASS skill "

    "like this', 'I hate when you Y' — embed the lesson in the skill "
    "that governs that task so the next session starts fixed.\n"

    "emerged.\n"
    "  • A skill that was loaded or consulted turned out wrong, "
    "missing, or outdated — patch it now.\n\n"
    "Preference order for skills — pick the earliest that fits:\n"
    "  1. UPDATE A CURRENTLY-LOADED SKILL. Check what skills were "
    "loaded via /skill-name or skill_view in the conversation. If one "
    "of them covers the learning, PATCH it first. It was in play; "
    "it's the right place — provided it is curator-managed. Protected "
    "and user-owned skills are off-limits however relevant; fall "
    "through when one of those is the best fit.\n"
    "  2. UPDATE AN EXISTING UMBRELLA (skills_list + skill_view to "
    "find the right one). Patch it.\n"
    "  3. ADD A SUPPORT FILE under an existing umbrella via "
    "skill_manage action=write_file. Three kinds: "
    "`references/<topic>.md` for session-specific detail OR condensed "
    "knowledge banks (quoted research, API docs excerpts, domain "
    "notes) written concise and task-focused; `templates/<name>.<ext>` "
    "for starter files meant to be copied and modified; "
    "`scripts/<name>.<ext>` for statically re-runnable actions "
    "(verification, fixture generators, probes). Add a one-line "
    "pointer in SKILL.md so future agents find them.\n"
    "  4. CREATE A NEW CLASS-LEVEL UMBRELLA when nothing exists. "
    "Name at the class level — NOT a PR number, error string, "
    "codename, library-alone name, or 'fix-X / debug-Y' session "
    "artifact. If the name only fits today's task, fall back to (1), "

    "  • PINNED skills (marked via 'hermes curator pin'). Pin blocks "
    "autonomous writes entirely — content updates included — because no "
    "user is present to consent. Only a foreground session can change one.\n"
    "  • USER-OWNED skills — anything not curator-managed (hand-written, "
